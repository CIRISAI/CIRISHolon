# Benchmark manifest — measured ratios or it didn't happen

Rule: a performance claim without a moved, recorded ratio does not merge.

| tier | workload | ours | reference | ratio | date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| tableau (packed, holon crate) | n=256 d=5120 + full measure | **0.0078 s** | qiskit StabilizerState 0.024 s | **3.1× faster** | 2026-08-27 |
| tableau (unpacked, holon-qasm) | n=256 d=5120 sample | 0.052 s | qiskit 0.024 s | 0.45× | 2026-08-27 |
| statevector (holon-qasm) | n=20 d=160 | 0.096 s | qiskit Statevector 1.44 s | **15× faster** | 2026-08-27 |
| magic (holon-qasm, exact Z[ω]) | slope in T | 1.005 log2-s/T | no exact reference exists | — | 2026-08-27 |

Named SOTA targets: Stim (Clifford; est. 1–2 orders beyond us — SIMD,
transposed layouts), Aer/qsim (statevector; est. 10–50×), Bravyi–Gosset
extent (magic; 2^t → 2^{0.48t}), ITensor (bulk).
